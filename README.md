Contains examples of projects I've done using R

#########Project 1:  Criticially Endangered Species Trends##########

The purpose of this project was to explore the growing trend of critically endangered species and demonstrate the use of "tabulizer" to scrape data (tables from a PDF).

This repository contains the R code, as well as the original PDF and a workflow diagram, that illustrates the process.

Note: I am new to R and this was my first time to use the "tabulizer" package, so all comments are welcome.

IMPORTANT:  The correct version of JAVA must be loaded before using Tabulizer.
